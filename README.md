# AppliedCatsVsDogs
Creating an end-to-end application for machine learning and machine vision

Based off of https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
Using the Kaggle cat vs dogs data https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

Using python, keras, and tensorflow, on Ubuntu 16.04, with NVIDIA GPU support.

Intel Core i5-4430 CPU @3GHz (4 cores), 8GB memory, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970.

The repository contains:

catsvsdogs2.py
Used to prepare data, desgin model, and train model.


predict_catsvsdogs2.py
Used to make predictions of class probability on unseen data.

data_aug.py
Used to augment a small training dataset through image manipulation.
